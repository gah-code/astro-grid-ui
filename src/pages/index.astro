<BaseLayout title='my first Astro page of this site'>
  <div class='container'>
    <p>Astro is pretty neat, and really easy to use!</p>
    <p>
      By placing content inside of is Layout, it's being inserted where the Slot
      is in the template, which is really neat!
    </p>
    <h2>Astro has a lot of benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It ships zero JavaScript by default</li>
      <li>Very customizable</li>
      <li>
        Framework agnostic (you don’t need to use a JS framework, or you can use
        React, Svelte, Vue, etc. (or even combine them))
      </li>
      <li>Fantastic documentation</li>
      <li>Easy to level up with</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</BaseLayout>
